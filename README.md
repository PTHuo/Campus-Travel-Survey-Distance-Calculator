# Campus Travel Survey Distance Calculator
Built for the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies

The Distance Calculator is a GUI app based on Python 3. It takes in CSV files produced by ArcGIS's geocoding tool, calculates the duration and distance of each set of coordinates to the UC Davis campus, and saves the results in your computer.
